## Introduction
`zcached` aims to offer rapid, in-memory caching akin to widely-used databases such as Redis. Its focus lies in user-friendliness, efficiency, and agility, making it suitable for various applications requiring swift data retrieval and storage.

Crafted using Zig, a versatile, modern, compiled programming language, `zcached` prides itself on a zero-dependency architecture. This unique feature enables seamless compilation and execution across systems equipped with a Zig compiler, ensuring exceptional portability and deployment ease.

## Features
- **Zero-Dependency Architecture**: Entirely built using Zig, ensuring seamless execution across systems with a Zig compiler, enhancing portability.
- **Lightweight Design**: Engineered for efficiency, `zcached` boasts a small memory footprint and minimal CPU usage, optimizing performance while conserving resources.
- **Optimized Efficiency**: Prioritizing swift data handling, `zcached` ensures prompt operations to cater to diverse application needs.
- **Diverse Data Type Support**: Accommodates various data structures like strings, integers, floats, and lists, enhancing utility across different use cases.
- **Evented I/O and Multithreading**: Leveraging evented I/O mechanisms and multithreading capabilities, zcached efficiently manages concurrent operations, enhancing responsiveness and scalability.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- [zig](https://ziglang.org/download/) (0.12.0 or newer)

### Building from Source
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone
```
2. Build the project
```bash
zig build
```
3. Run the executable
```bash
./zcached
```

## Running Tests
Run this command in the root directory of the project:
```bash
zig test src/test.zig -lc
```

## Usage
While `zcached` lacks a CLI, you can utilize nc (netcat) from the terminal to send commands to the server.

### Example Commands

For all supported commands and their syntaxt, see [commands.md](commands.md)

#### SET
Set a key to hold the string value. If key already holds a value, it is overwritten, regardless of its type.
```bash
echo "*3\r\n\$3\r\nSET\r\n\$9\r\nmycounter\r\n:42\r\n" | netcat -N localhost 7556
```

```bash
echo "*3\r\n\$3\r\nSET\r\n\$9\r\nmycounter\r\n%2\r\n+first\r\n:1\r\n+second\r\n:2\r\n" | netcat -N localhost 7556
```

#### Command Breakdown:
- `*3\r\n` - number of elements in the array (commands are always arrays)
- `\$3\r\nSET\r\n` - `$3` denotes the following string as 3 bytes long, SET is the command
- `\$9\r\nmycounter\r\n` - `$9` means that the next string is 9 bytes long, `mycounter` is the key
- `:42\r\n` - `:` indicates the next string is a number, `42` is the value

#### GET
Retrieve the value of a key. If the key doesnâ€™t exist, `-not found` is returned. GET only accepts strings as keys.
```bash
echo "*2\r\n\$3\r\nGET\r\n\$9\r\nmycounter\r\n" | netcat -N localhost 7556
```

#### PING
Returns `PONG`. This command is often used to test if a connection is still alive, or to measure latency.
```bash
echo "*1\r\n$4\r\nPING\r\n" | netcat -N localhost 7556
```

for supported types and their encodings, see [types.md](types.md)

## Todo for v1.0.0
- [ ] Support for more data types eg. Hashes, Sets, Sorted Sets. (Currently only supports Strings, Integers, Floats, Booleans, Nulls, Arrays, and HashMaps).
- [x] Create CLI Interface.
- [x] Persistance mechanism, for further usage.
- [x] Add `DBSIZE` command for getting the number of keys in the database.
- [ ] Asynchronous save, `ASAVE`.
- [x] Handle all panics and write the backtrace into log file.
- [x] Server events logging.
- [x] Configurable server (port, max clients, max memory, etc.).
- [x] Connections whitelisting.
- [x] Pass different configuration file path from command line.
- [ ] Client side library.
- [ ] *Encrypted connections, e.g TLS 1.3 or use QUIC (Currently there is no server-side support for TLS in zig, I could use `https://github.com/shiguredo/tls13-zig`).
